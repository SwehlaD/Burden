    <h3>“I WAS THERE”</h3>

    <p><strong>Seeing Ourselves at the Cross</strong></p>
    <p>One of the great dangers when reading the Gospel accounts of Christ’s death is imagining ourselves as observers rather than participants. We read of the disciples, the priests, the rulers, the soldiers, and the crowds, and we instinctively place ourselves at a safe distance. But the cross does not permit spectators. This song presses us to confess with honesty: I was there.</p>

    <p>The song teaches us to confess ourselves. And even this confession is mercy, for the ability to see our sin rightly is already a gift of grace.</p>

    <p><strong>A Word About the Man on the Cross</strong></p>
    <p>The man beside Jesus is given to us not so that we might delay repentance, but so that we might never despair of grace. Scripture records one such example, so that no sinner may say it is too late—but only one, so that no sinner may presume upon tomorrow.</p>

    <p>The man’s faith did not save him because it came at the end of life, but because Christ gave him eyes to see, and he responded at once. We are not promised a final hour beside the cross, nor a last moment of clarity. The call of the Gospel is therefore for today: to look to Christ now, to trust Him while He is near, knowing that when He calls us before Himself, it will be as the King we have either trusted or ignored.</p>

    <p><strong>A Word of Gospel Call and Perseverance</strong></p>
    <p>At this point, the cross confronts us all. To those who do not yet know Christ, the man beside Jesus stands as a call to repent and believe today, while mercy is held out. To those who belong to Christ, he stands as a call to endure—to hang on in faith, even when obedience is costly and the end is near.</p>

    <p>The man did not earn salvation by suffering, yet in faith he bore his cross and followed Jesus in the only way left to him: trusting the King beside him and committing himself wholly to Christ. Whether called to first belief or to steadfast perseverance, the Gospel presses us to the same response—to look to Christ alone and follow Him wherever He leads.</p>

    <h2>GUIDED READING</h2>

    <p><strong>Confession at the Cross</strong></p>
    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    I was there when dawn broke forth,<br>
    And judgment filled the air;<br>
    I did not pass as stranger by—<br>
    I stood among them there.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> Begin here. The cross does not allow distance. We are not observers looking back at history, but sinners standing beneath judgment. To say “I was there” is already an act of honesty God grants by grace.</p>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    I was like those heavy-eyed,<br>
    Made dull and slow to heed;<br>
    My flesh refused the watchful call,<br>
    Too slothful for the need.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> Here we confess not hostility, but neglect. Sloth is quiet but deadly.</p>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    I was like the one warned in love,<br>
    My heart grown cold and hardened;<br>
    I heard His word, but harbored sin,<br>
    And walked into the garden.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> This is willful sin—hearing Christ clearly and choosing another way. Yet seeing this rightly is itself mercy.</p>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    I was like those sworn to stay,<br>
    Yet scattered in the night;<br>
    When danger came and courage failed,<br>
    I fled beyond the light.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> Promises are easy before pressure comes. This stanza names the gap between intention and faithfulness—a gap we all know.</p>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    I was like one who followed still,<br>
    But watched from far away;<br>
    I kept my place, I guarded self,<br>
    And would not fully stay.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> Distance feels safe. The cross exposes this half-hearted following.</p>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    I was like one who said, “I do<br>
    Not know the Man,” in fear;<br>
    Before a servant’s searching voice<br>
    My courage disappeared.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> Fear, not hatred, often drives denial. This stanza reminds us how fragile courage can be when faith is tested publicly.</p>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    I was like those who knew the Law,<br>
    Yet missed the Law made flesh;<br>
    I chose my peace, my standing safe,<br>
    And judged the Christ afresh.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> Knowledge alone does not save. It is possible to handle Scripture and still miss the Savior to whom it points.</p>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    I was like the one who saw truth,<br>
    Yet washed his hands in fear;<br>
    I knew Him just, yet let Him die<br>
    To keep my power clear.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> This stanza confronts moral compromise—the sin of choosing stability, reputation, or control over obedience.</p>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    I was like those in garb of scorn,<br>
    Who crowned His head with thorn;<br>
    I bowed in jest before the King<br>
    And mocked the One forlorn.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> Mockery is not always loud. Sometimes it appears as sarcasm, dismissal, or refusal to worship Christ as He truly is.</p>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    I was like the royal one there,<br>
    Who sought to please my sight;<br>
    I mocked the truth and sought a trick,<br>
    And kept my throne in might.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> Curiosity without repentance leaves us unchanged.</p>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    I was like the one whose hands were raised,<br>
    Who drove the iron through;<br>
    I did my task with steady hands<br>
    As if it were not true.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> Here we confess participation—doing what is required, following orders, claiming neutrality where none exists.</p>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    I was like those who passed Him by<br>
    And mocked His dying breath;<br>
    My voice was joined to scornful words<br>
    That followed Him in death.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> Silence can also mock. Passing by the cross without response is itself a response.</p>

    <p><strong>Grace Revealed</strong></p>
    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    But mercy spoke where guilt stood fast,<br>
    And grace broke through the night.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> This is the turning point. Sin has been named fully—and now grace enters, not because guilt softened, but because Christ bore it.</p>

    <p><strong>Eyes Opened</strong></p>
    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    Now let me be the one who stood<br>
    When earth and heaven shook;<br>
    Who saw the Son breathe out His life<br>
    And owned what death forsook.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> Like the centurion, sight is given. Faith begins not with explanation, but with recognition.</p>
    <p><em>Response:</em> Truly this was the Son of God.</p>

    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    Now let me be the one who turned<br>
    When hope was nearly gone;<br>
    Who saw a kingdom through the cross<br>
    And called on Christ alone.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> Here is faith stripped of everything but trust. No merit, no time, no defense—only Christ.</p>
    <p><em>Response:</em><br>
    Jesus, Lord, remember me,<br>
    When Your kingdom come.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Testimony and Perseverance</strong></p>
    <p><em>Stanza:</em><br>
    Now I am made new by His grace,<br>
    Once lost, now reconciled;<br>
    I see the cross, I hear His voice,<br>
    And live as God’s own child.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> This is not a vow, but testimony. New life flows from grace received, not effort supplied.</p>

    <p><strong>Final Confession</strong></p>
    <p><em>Closing:</em><br>
    I see myself beneath the tree;<br>
    My hope is Christ who died for me.
    </p>
    <p><em>Reflection:</em> This is the answer of the whole song, the devotional, and the Gospel itself. We end where we must always stand—beneath the cross, resting in Christ alone.</p>
