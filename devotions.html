    <h3>“I WAS THERE”</h3><br>
    <p><strong>Seeing ourselves at the Cross</strong></p><br>
    <p>
     One of the great dangers when reading the Gospel accounts of Christ’s death is imagining ourselves as observers rather than participants. We read of the disciples, the priests, the rulers, the soldiers, and the crowds, and we instinctively place ourselves at a safe distance. But the cross does not permit spectators. This hymn presses us to confess with honesty: I was there. We see ourselves in the ones who slept when Christ called them to watch—too dull, too distracted, too comfortable. We see ourselves in the one warned in love who still carried sin knowingly into the garden. We see ourselves in those who followed at a distance, close enough to appear faithful, far enough to avoid cost. We see ourselves in the one who denied Christ out of fear, in those who knew the Law but missed the Law made flesh, and in the one who saw the truth yet washed his hands to preserve peace and power.
We see ourselves in the mockers who clothed Christ in shame, in the ruler who wanted spectacle without repentance, in the one whose hands were raised to carry out injustice, and in the crowd who passed by in indifference. The hymn does not accuse them. It teaches us to confess ourselves. And even this confession is mercy, for the ability to see our sin rightly is already a gift of grace
