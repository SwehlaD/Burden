  <h2>DEVOTIONS</h2>

  <div class="devotion">
    <h3>“I WAS THERE”</h3><br>
    <p><strong>Seeing ourselves at the Cross</strong></p><br>
    <p>
     One of the great dangers when reading the Gospel accounts of Christ’s death is imagining ourselves as observers rather than participants. We read of the disciples, the priests, the rulers, the soldiers, and the crowds, and we instinctively place ourselves at a safe distance. But the cross does not permit spectators. This hymn presses us to confess with honesty: I was there. We see ourselves in the ones who slept when Christ called them to watch—too dull, too distracted, too comfortable. We see ourselves in the one warned in love who still carried sin knowingly into the garden. We see ourselves in those who followed at a distance, close enough to appear faithful, far enough to avoid cost. We see ourselves in the one who denied Christ out of fear, in those who knew the Law but missed the Law made flesh, and in the one who saw the truth yet washed his hands to preserve peace and power.
We see ourselves in the mockers who clothed Christ in shame, in the ruler who wanted spectacle without repentance, in the one whose hands were raised to carry out injustice, and in the crowd who passed by in indifference. The hymn does not accuse them. It teaches us to confess ourselves. And even this confession is mercy, for the ability to see our sin rightly is already a gift of grace.
    </p><br>

     <p><strong>A Word About the Man on the Cross</strong></p><br>
    <p>The man beside Jesus is given to us not so that we might delay repentance, but so that we might never despair of grace. Scripture records one such example, so that no sinner may say it is too late—but only one, so that no sinner may presume upon tomorrow. The man’s faith did not save him because it came at the end of life, but because Christ gave him eyes to see, and he responded at once. We are not promised a final hour beside the cross, nor a last moment of clarity. The call of the Gospel is therefore for today: to look to Christ now, to trust Him while He is near, knowing that when He calls us before Himself, it will be as the King we have either trusted or ignored.
    </p><br>

     <p><strong>A Word of Gospel Call and Perseverance</strong></p><br>
    <p>At this point, the cross confronts us all. To those who do not yet know Christ, the man beside Jesus stands as a call to repent and believe today, while mercy is held out. To those who belong to Christ, he stands as a call to endure—to hang on in faith, even when obedience is costly and the end is near. The man did not earn salvation by suffering, yet in faith he bore his cross and followed Jesus in the only way left to him: trusting the King beside him and committing himself wholly to Christ. Whether called to first belief or to steadfast perseverance, the Gospel presses us to the same response—to look to Christ alone and follow Him wherever He leads.

    <h3>Guided Reading. "I Was There"</h3><br>
     <p><strong>Confession at the Cross</strong></p><br>
    <p>Stanza:

I was there when dawn broke forth,

And judgment filled the air;

I did not pass as stranger by—

I stood among them there.

Reflection:

Begin here. The cross does not allow distance. We are not observers looking back at history, but sinners standing beneath judgment. To say “I was there” is already an act of honesty God grants by grace.

Stanza:

I was like those heavy-eyed,

Made dull and slow to heed;

My flesh refused the watchful call,

Too slothful for the need.

Reflection:

Here we confess not hostility, but neglect. How often has Christ called us to watch, pray, and remain alert—and we have chosen ease instead? Sloth is quiet, but deadly.


Stanza:

I was like the one warned in love,

My heart grown cold and hardened;

I heard His word, but harbored sin,

And walked into the garden.

Reflection:

This is willful sin—hearing Christ clearly and choosing another way. The tragedy is not ignorance, but resistance. Yet even seeing this rightly is itself mercy.


Stanza:

I was like those sworn to stay,

Yet scattered in the night;

When danger came and courage failed,

I fled beyond the light.

Reflection:

Promises are easy before pressure comes. This stanza names the gap between intention and faithfulness—a gap we all know.


Stanza:

I was like one who followed still,

But watched from far away;

I kept my place, I guarded self,

And would not fully stay.

Reflection:

Distance feels safe. We remain near enough to claim association, but far enough to avoid cost. The cross exposes this half-hearted following.


Stanza:

I was like one who said, “I do

Not know the Man,” in fear;

Before a servant’s searching voice

My courage disappeared.

Reflection:

Fear, not hatred, often drives denial. This stanza reminds us how fragile courage can be when faith is tested publicly.


Stanza:

I was like those who knew the Law,

Yet missed the Law made flesh;

I chose my peace, my standing safe,

And judged the Christ afresh.

Reflection:

Knowledge alone does not save. It is possible to handle Scripture and still miss the Savior to whom it points.


Stanza:

I was like the one who saw truth,

Yet washed his hands in fear;

I knew Him just, yet let Him die

To keep my power clear.

Reflection:

This stanza confronts moral compromise—the sin of choosing stability, reputation, or control over obedience.


Stanza:

I was like those in garb of scorn,

Who crowned His head with thorn;

I bowed in jest before the King

And mocked the One forlorn.

Reflection:

Mockery is not always loud. Sometimes it appears as sarcasm, dismissal, or refusal to worship Christ as He truly is.


Stanza:

I was like the royal one there,

Who sought to please my sight;

I mocked the truth and sought a trick,

And kept my throne in might.

Reflection:

Curiosity without repentance leaves us unchanged. We may want signs, experiences, or insight—without surrender.


Stanza:

I was like the one whose hands were raised,

Who drove the iron through;

I did my task with steady hands

As if it were not true.

Reflection:

Here we confess participation—doing what is required, following orders, claiming neutrality where none exists.


Stanza:

I was like those who passed Him by

And mocked His dying breath;

My voice was joined to scornful words

That followed Him in death.

Reflection:

Silence can also mock. Passing by the cross without response is itself a response.
